<h3><a name="aristotle" id="aristotle"></a>Aristotle</h3>
<p><strong>Aristotle (384 BC - March 7, 322 BC)</strong> was an ancient Greek philosopher, student of Plato and teacher of 
  Alexander the Great. He wrote many books about physics, poetry, zoology, logic, rhetoric, government, and biology. </p>
<h3><a name="darwin" id="darwin"></a>Charles Darwin</h3>
<p><strong>Charles Darwin (Feb. 12, 1809 - April 19, 1882)</strong> was an English naturalist renowned for his documentation of evolution 
  and for his theory of its operation, known as Darwinism. His evolutionary theories, propounded chiefly in two works--On the Origin of Species 
  by Means of Natural Selection (1859) and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871)--have had a 
  profound influence on subsequent scientific thought.</p>
<h3><a name="edison" id="acids_bases2"></a>Thomas Edison</h3>
<p><strong>Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 - Oct. 18, 1931)</strong> was an American inventor who, singly or jointly, 
  held a world record 1,093 patents. In addition, he created the world's first industrial research laboratory.</p>
<p>Edison was the quintessential American inventor in the era of Yankee ingenuity. He began his career in 1863, 
  in the adolescence of the telegraph industry, when virtually the only source of electricity was primitive <br />
  batteries putting out a low-voltage current.</p>
<p>Before he died, in 1931, he had played a critical role in introducing the modern age of electricity. 
  From his laboratories and workshops emanated the phonograph, the carbon-button transmitter for the telephone <br />
  speaker and microphone, the incandescent lamp, a revolutionary generator of unprecedented efficiency, the first commercial 
  electric light and power system, an experimental electric railroad, and key elements of motion-picture apparatus, as well as a host of other inventions.</p>
<h3><a name="eintein" id="ph_scale2"></a>Albert Eintein</h3>
<p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely considered one of the greatest physicists of all time.</p>
<p>While best known for the theory of relativity (and specifically mass-energy equivalence, E=mc2), he was awarded the 1921 
  Nobel Prize in Physics for his 1905 (Annus Mirabilis) explanation of the photoelectric effect and &quot;for his services to Theoretical Physics&quot;. 
  In popular culture, the name &quot;Einstein&quot; has become synonymous with great intelligence and genius. <br />
  Einstein was named Time magazine's &quot;Man of the Century.&quot;</p>
<p>He was known for many scientific investigations, among which were: his special theory of relativity which stemmed 
  from an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field, his general theory 
  of relativity which extended the principle of relativity to include gravitation, relativistic cosmology, capillary 
  action, critical opalescence, classical problems of statistical mechanics and problems in which they were merged with 
  quantum theory, leading to an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules; atomic transition probabilities, 
  the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory, the quantum theory of a monatomic gas, the thermal properties of light 
  with a low radiation density which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light, the theory of radiation, 
  including stimulated emission; the construction of a unified field theory, and the geometrization of physics. <br />
</p>
<h3><a name="galilei" id="acids_bases3"></a>Galileo Galilei</h3>
<p><strong>Galileo Galilei</strong> was a Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major 
  role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent <br />
  astronomical observations, and support for Copernicanism. </p>
<h3><a name="newton" id="ph_scale3"></a>Isaac Newton</h3>
<p><strong>Sir Isaac Newton (January 4, 1643 - March 31, 1727)</strong> was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, 
  alchemist, and natural philosopher who is generally regarded as one of the greatest scientists and mathematicians 
  in history. Newton wrote the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in which he described universal 
  gravitation and the three laws of motion, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics. By deriving Kepler's 
  laws of planetary motion from this system, he was the first to show that the motion of objects on Earth and of 
  celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws. The unifying and deterministic power of his laws 
  was integral to the scientific revolution and the advancement of heliocentrism. </p>
